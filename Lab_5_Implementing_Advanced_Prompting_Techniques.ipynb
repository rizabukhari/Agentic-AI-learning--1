            "\n",

With a 60% allocation to equities, Sameer can benefit from the capital appreciation necessary to build wealth, while the 30% in debt provides a cushion against market volatility. The 10% allocation to alternatives offers diversification, which can enhance returns and reduce risk. This balanced approach allows Sameer to pursue his retirement goals without taking on excessive risk, making it the most suitable choice for his profile.\n",

She would make minimum payments on her other debts (personal loan and car loan) while allocating the remaining funds to the credit card debt until it is paid off. Once the credit card is cleared, she would move on to the personal loan and then the car loan.\n",

The goal would be to secure a loan with an interest rate lower than the average of her current debts, making it easier to manage payments and potentially reducing the total interest paid.\n",

            "**Justification:** The Debt Avalanche strategy is the most suitable for Priya due to her current financial situation. Although it may feel slower initially, it will ultimately save her the most money in interest payments. Given that the credit card debt has a significantly higher interest rate, prioritizing it will reduce the total interest paid, allowing her to become debt-free faster in the long run. \n",
